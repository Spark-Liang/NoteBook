  - a new member must wait a period of time to become eligible after enroll in the group.
  
  - If meet all other requirement, **for noncontrbutory plan, eligible after the probationary period end, for contributory plan, will start the eligibilty period.**

- **eligibility period (enrollment period)**
  
  - a period that a new group member enroll the contributory plan without the evidence of insurability.

  - **the larger the group, the actual loss rate more closer to the estimated lose rate**
  
  - the lose rate estimation on small group
    
    - group with fewer than 15 people, each people need to provide the evidence of insurability.
    
    - group with 15 to 50 members, pools several groups to estimate the lose rate.

    - for noncontributory plan, required 100 percentage eligible member participate.
    
    - for contributory plan, required at least 75 percentage.

- **Determination of benefit level**
  
  - **benefit schedule** : the schedule in insurance policy to define the amount of life insurance for each insured.
  
  - a common method to design the benefit is to vary the benefit amount according to specifiec objectve criteria, such as salary or length of employment.

    - limit the optional coverage that can offer
    
    - require the insured group member to provide the evidence of insurability.

- **Nature of Business**
  
  - the type of work that group member perform will effect the risk.

###### Group Insurance Premium

- methods to calculate the premium rate
  
  - **manual rating**
    
    - establish the rate by its own experience rather than the experience of the particular group's prior claims.
    
    - this method usually used in setting the initial premium rate for large group or both the initial and renewal premium for the small group. Because in these cases are lack of claim experience.
  
  - **experience rating**
    
    - setting the rate by considering the particular group's prior claim experience.
    
    - always used in setting the renewal premium for large group or initial premium with the large group the insured by another company.
  
  - **Blended rating**
    
    - use a combination of manual rating and experience rating.

- **How to calculate premium amount**
  
  - **premium amount** = (**coverage amount per employee** / 1000) X **premium rate for each coverage unit** X **number of employee**
  
  - **premium payable amount is varies each month, because of the change of the number of employee.**

- **Premium refund**
  
  - If the claim expense and other expense in the policy year lower than the premium, the insurer will refund the exceed part to the policyholder.
  
  - the refund is payable to policyholder not group member, even if the contributory plan
  
  - If the amount of the refund greater than the portion of the group premium that was paid to the policyholder's fund, the exceed part must be used for the benefit of the individual participate in the plan
